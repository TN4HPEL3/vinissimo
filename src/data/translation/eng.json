  "aboutUsPrimaryFirst": "Vinissimo Restaurant & Wine Bar is the new brand under which Sztuczka Bistro, present at Bema 6 since 2017, has been operating since February 2024. The restaurant, run since 2022 by Łukasz Chwojnicki, in a slightly changed format and with the same irreplaceable team, invariably serves delicious and minimalist cuisine, backed by a huge wine selection and impeccable service.",
  "aboutUsPrimarySecond": "The head chef, since June 2023, is the humble and talented Luke Theus, who has worked with many great chefs. In charge of service, wines and the work of the entire restaurant is the manager - Diana Kalinichenko, who has worked in the best restaurants in the Tri-City and, despite her young age, has a lot of experience, which she skilfully uses to take care of our guests.",
  "aboutUsSecondaryFirst": "Vino, Vinissimo, meaning...wine, extraordinary wine, sounds just as beautiful and intriguing in every language. It is our trademark. Over 400 labels, 70 of which are available by the glass. Four experienced sommeliers, Riedel glasses - dedicated to different grape varietals, Coravin. Conventional, natural, biodynamic. Legends, freaks and classics. All of this allows us to cater for everyone: from the beginner for whom any residual sugar in wine is good, to the wine lover who will drink Colares 1969 with lunch. Wine egalitarianism reigns with us, and as important to us, basic Primitivo, or unique Sassicaia, it is important that you enjoy both.",
  "aboutUsSecondarySecond": "Our menu features minimalist dishes based on classics from seasonal products. We work with the highest quality ingredients. On the menu you will find Wagyu beef, Skrei cod, black winter truffle, fresh oysters, Ibérico pork and many other delicacies. All our dishes are ideal for sharing, which we invariably encourage our guests to do.",
